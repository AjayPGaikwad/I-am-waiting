        <h1>Dear Pratiksha (Cutiepie)</h1>
        <p>I hope this letter finds you well. I've been thinking a lot lately about the moment I asked you to be mine,
            and although you haven't given me an answer yet, I understand that you might need some time.</p>
        <p>I want you to know that I appreciate your shyness and your desire to express yourself in your own way. It's
            one of the things I love about you - your thoughtful nature and your ability to make every moment special.
        </p>
        <p>Every day with you feels like a gift, and I'm grateful for the love and happiness you bring into my life.
            You're the most amazing person I've ever met, and I can't imagine my life without you.</p>
        <p>So, as you take your time to find the right words, just know that my heart is open and waiting for you. I'll
            be here, ready to listen whenever you're ready to share your feelings.</p>
        <p class="signature">With all my love and patience,<br>Ajay</p>
